Flatlake is a static API generator. The goal of Flatlake is to expose a headless CMS interface over a set of static git-based files.

Flatlake has the primary goals:

- Ease migrations from a headless CMS to git-based content management, as existing frontends can maintain their architecture.
- Open up new use cases for git-based content, such as integration into mobile applications and existing systems.
- Provide new abilities for aggregating and sharing data between multiple static websites in an organization.

From a set of input Markdown files with front matter, Flatlake will generate a set of JSON files that allow you to query your data. These files are suitable to host as an API on a domain, or they can be loaded in to another static site generate as data files.

For example, if Flatlake is supplied a folder of markdown files in a `posts` folder, the API generated by Flatlake would provide endpoints such as:

- `https://my-hosted-api.com/posts/post-one.json`
- `https://my-hosted-api.com/posts/all/page-1.json`
- `https://my-hosted-api.com/posts/aggregate/author/cloudcannon/page-1.json`

Providing the ability to, for example:

- Fetch the latest 10 posts with a given author.
- Display the latest news article on all websites within your organization.
- Load individual endpoints into a mobile application dynamically.
